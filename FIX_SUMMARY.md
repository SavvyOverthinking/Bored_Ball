# üéØ Fix Summary - Deployment & Code Review

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ All fixes applied, ready to deploy

---

## üì¶ What Was Fixed

### **1. Deployment Infrastructure** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** 4 conflicting GitHub Actions workflows causing deployment failures

**Solution:**
- Created unified workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-unified.yml`
- Uses npm consistently
- Automatically creates `.nojekyll` file
- Builds Phase 2 by default
- Single source of truth for deployments

**Files Changed:**
- ‚úÖ Created: `.github/workflows/deploy-unified.yml`

**Files to Delete on GitHub:**
- ‚ùå `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- ‚ùå `.github/workflows/deploy-phase2.yml`
- ‚ùå `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml`

### **2. Package Manager Standardization** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Mixed npm and pnpm causing dependency conflicts

**Solution:**
- Standardized on **npm** (already have package-lock.json)
- Removed `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- Updated all workflows to use npm

**Files Changed:**
- ‚úÖ Deleted: `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- ‚úÖ Updated: `.github/workflows/deploy-unified.yml`

### **3. Production Code Cleanup** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Console.log statements in production config

**Solution:**
- Removed debug logs from `vite.config.ts`
- Cleaner production builds

**Files Changed:**
- ‚úÖ Updated: `vite.config.ts`

### **4. Build Scripts Simplification** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Confusing build script names

**Solution:**
- `npm run build` ‚Üí Builds Phase 2 (production default)
- `npm run build:v1` ‚Üí Builds v1.0 (if needed)
- `npm run dev:phase2` ‚Üí Dev server for Phase 2
- `npm run dev:v1` ‚Üí Dev server for v1.0

**Files Changed:**
- ‚úÖ Updated: `package.json`

## üöÄ How to Deploy (Quick Version)

### **Step 1: Clean Up GitHub Workflows**
Delete these 3 files on GitHub:
1. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. `.github/workflows/deploy-phase2.yml`
3. `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml`

**‚Üí See GITHUB_CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md for detailed steps**

### **Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages**
1. Go to repo Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"**

### **Step 3: Push Changes**
```bash
cd ~/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/Bored_Ball

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "fix: resolve deployment conflicts and standardize on npm"

# Push (triggers deployment)
git push origin main
```

### **Step 4: Verify**
1. Watch: https://github.com/SavvyOverthinking/Bored_Ball/actions
2. Wait for ‚úÖ green checkmark
3. Visit: https://savvyoverthinking.github.io/Bored_Ball/
4. Test the game

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Before pushing:
- [x] Removed conflicting workflow logic
- [x] Created unified deployment workflow
- [x] Standardized package manager (npm)
- [x] Cleaned up production code
- [x] Updated build scripts
- [x] Documented everything

After pushing:
- [ ] Old workflows deleted on GitHub
- [ ] GitHub Pages source set to "GitHub Actions"
- [ ] Deployment workflow runs successfully
- [ ] Site loads at https://savvyoverthinking.github.io/Bored_Ball/
- [ ] Game is playable
- [ ] No console errors

---

## üêõ Known Issues Remaining

These are **not blockers** for deployment but should be addressed:

1. **No automated tests** (see CODE_REVIEW_REPORT.md)
2. **Code duplication** between Phase 1 and Phase 2
3. **Large scene files** (MainScene.ts 1000+ lines)
4. **TypeScript 'any' types** allowed in config
5. **Console.logs** in game scenes (MainScenePhase2.ts)

**Priority:** Medium - address in next sprint

## üí° Key Takeaways

### **What Caused the Deployment Failures:**
1. Multiple workflows fighting for same deployment slot
2. Jekyll workflow trying to process Vite build
3. Package manager mismatch (pnpm vs npm)
4. Missing `.nojekyll` file

### **Why Phase 2 Deployment Failed Specifically:**
1. Built to `dist-phase2/` but workflow looked in `dist/`
2. Filename mismatch (`index-phase2.html` not renamed)
3. Wrong environment variables in some workflows

### **How the Fix Works:**
1. Single workflow builds to `dist/`
2. Automatically handles Phase 2 naming
3. Creates `.nojekyll` during build
4. Consistent npm usage throughout
5. Proper concurrency control

## üéâ Success Metrics

**After deployment, you should see:**
- ‚úÖ Site loads without errors
- ‚úÖ Game runs smoothly
- ‚úÖ Phase 2 features working (power-ups, difficulty curve)
- ‚úÖ Assets loading correctly (no 404s)
- ‚úÖ Consistent performance

**GitHub Actions should show:**
- ‚úÖ Single "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- ‚úÖ Green checkmarks on every push
- ‚úÖ ~2-3 minute deployment time

---

## üí¨ Questions?

1. **Why npm instead of pnpm?**
   - You already had package-lock.json
   - Better GitHub Actions compatibility
   - Simpler for contributors

2. **Why delete Phase 2 workflow?**
   - Can't have multiple workflows deploying to same Pages site
   - Unified workflow handles both v1.0 and Phase 2

3. **Will v1.0 still work?**
   - Yes! Use `npm run build:v1` if needed
   - Default deployment is Phase 2 (better version)

4. **Can I switch back to v1.0 deployment?**
   - Yes, edit deploy-unified.yml
   - Change `npm run build` to `npm run build:v1`

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ **READY TO DEPLOY**  
**Next Action:** Delete old workflows on GitHub, then push  
**Time to Deploy:** ~5 minutes (cleanup) + 3 minutes (GitHub Actions)
