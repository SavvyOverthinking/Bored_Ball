# Phase 2 Development Status

## 🎯 Goal
Add gentler early-game curve, weekly power-ups, and Weekend "Email Dodge" bonus stage.

## ✅ Completed Infrastructure

### 1. Build System ✅
- ✅ Feature flag system (`src/config/flags.ts`)
- ✅ Separate build targets (`dev:phase2`, `build:phase2`)
- ✅ Phase 2 entry points (`index-phase2.html`, `main-phase2.tsx`)
- ✅ Vite config updated for dual builds
- ✅ cross-env installed for cross-platform env vars

### 2. Core Systems ✅
- ✅ Level Curve (`src/game/levelCurve.ts`)
  - Progressive difficulty weeks 1-52
  - Gentle weeks 1-5 (larger paddle, slower ball)
  - Tuning for density, speed, paddle scale, ball count
- ✅ Power-up System (`src/game/powerups.ts`)
  - 5 power-up types defined
  - One per week maximum
  - Effect definitions and visuals
- ✅ Weekend Bonus Stage (`src/game/WeekendStageScene.ts`)
  - 30-second email dodge challenge
  - Appears every 5th week
  - Bonus scoring system
  - Full UI and game loop

### 3. Routing & Components ✅
- ✅ Phase 2 Router (`src/game/phase2Router.ts`)
  - Auto-routing to weekend stages
  - Week progression logic
  - Difficulty naming
- ✅ React Components
  - `CalendarBreakoutPhase2.tsx` - Phase 2 game wrapper
  - `App-phase2.tsx` - Phase 2 app entry

### 4. Documentation ✅
- ✅ Integration guide (`PHASE2_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
- ✅ This status document

## 🔨 In Progress

### MainScenePhase2 Implementation 🚧
**Status:** Stub created, needs full implementation

**File:** `src/game/MainScenePhase2.ts`

**What's Needed:**
1. Duplicate MainScene.ts (~1000 lines)
2. Apply level tuning to block generation
3. Implement power-up spawning logic
4. Add power-up effect handlers
5. Integrate shield/coffee/paddle scaling
6. Use phase2Router for week transitions
7. Apply tuned speeds, paddle scales, ball counts

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** HIGH - Required for Phase 2 to function

**See:** `PHASE2_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed steps

## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] **Complete MainScenePhase2.ts** - Core game scene with Phase 2 features
- [ ] **Test v1.0 unaffected** - Verify `npm run build` still works
- [ ] **Test Phase 2 locally** - Run `pnpm dev:phase2`

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Create temporary power-up icons** - Simple vector graphics
- [ ] **Scoring system enhancements** - Combo multipliers, time bonuses
- [ ] **Summary scene** - Week end stats display

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Staging deployment** - Separate GitHub Pages or Vercel
- [ ] **QA testing** - Full playthrough weeks 1-52
- [ ] **Polish** - Visual effects, transitions, feedback

## 🚀 How to Continue

### Option A: Complete MainScenePhase2
```bash
# 1. Open MainScene.ts (v1.0)
# 2. Copy entire contents to MainScenePhase2.ts
# 3. Follow PHASE2_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md step-by-step
# 4. Test incrementally
```

### Option B: Incremental Integration
```bash
# 1. Get basic game loop working
# 2. Add one feature at a time:
#    - Level tuning
#    - Power-up spawning
#    - Power-up effects
#    - Router integration
```

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
```bash
# 1. Keep v1.0 MainScene as base
# 2. Add Phase 2 checks via feature flags
# 3. Gradually merge Phase 2 into v1.0
# 4. Less duplication, more complexity
```

## 🧪 Testing Commands

```bash
# v1.0 (should be unaffected)
npm run dev       # Port 3000
npm run build     # Builds to dist/

# Phase 2 (staging)
pnpm dev:phase2   # Port 3003
pnpm build:phase2 # Builds to dist-phase2/

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck    # Should pass for both

# Verify v1.0 works
npm run dev       # Test locally
npm run build     # Build production
```

## 📊 Completion Status

**Overall Progress:** 70%

- Infrastructure: 100% ✅
- Core Systems: 100% ✅
- Game Scene: 20% 🚧 (stub only)
- Testing: 0% ⏳
- Deployment: 0% ⏳

## 🎮 What Works Right Now

✅ Phase 2 flag system  
✅ Separate build targets  
✅ Level curve calculations  
✅ Power-up definitions  
✅ Weekend Dodge scene (standalone)  
✅ Phase 2 router logic  
✅ React components  

❌ Integrated gameplay loop  
❌ Power-up spawning in game  
❌ Level tuning applied to gameplay  
❌ Week transitions via router  
❌ Testing & QA  

## 🔥 Next Steps

1. **Complete MainScenePhase2.ts** (highest priority)
2. **Test Phase 2 locally** (`pnpm dev:phase2`)
3. **Verify v1.0 still works** (`npm run build`)
4. **Create simple power-up graphics**
5. **Test full 52-week playthrough**
6. **Deploy to staging**
