## 🎮 How to Test Phase 2

### Dev Server
```bash
pnpm run dev:phase2    # Runs on http://localhost:3003
```

### Build
```bash
pnpm run build:phase2  # Outputs to dist-phase2/
pnpm run preview:phase2 # Preview production build
```

### v1.0 (verify unaffected)
```bash
pnpm run dev           # http://localhost:3000
pnpm run build         # dist/
```

## ✨ Phase 2 Features Implemented

### 1. Gentler Early Game (Weeks 1-5)
- ✅ Larger paddle (1.2× scale)
- ✅ Slower ball (220 px/s vs 260 px/s)
- ✅ Easier meetings (35% density, 20% lunch rate)
- ✅ Max 2 balls
- ✅ Low boss rate (4%)

### 2. Progressive Difficulty Curve
- ✅ **Density**: 35% → 80% (week 52)
- ✅ **Boss rate**: 4% → 14%
- ✅ **Team rate**: 10% → 25%
- ✅ **Lunch rate**: 20% → 10%
- ✅ **Min block duration**: 45 → 15 minutes
- ✅ **Ball speed**: 220 → 300 px/s
- ✅ **Paddle scale**: 1.2× → 0.85×
- ✅ **Max balls**: 2 → 4

### 3. Weekly Power-ups (1 per week)
- ✅ **Coffee**: Steady speed for 15s (prevents chaotic speedups)
- ✅ **Happy Hour**: Wide paddle (1.4×) for 30s

- ✅ **Reschedule**: Clears all meetings in current hour row
- ✅ **Cleanup**: Softens 3 random meetings to lunch breaks (1 hit)
- ✅ Spawn delay: 8-16 seconds into the week
- ✅ Visual status indicator when active

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Separate entry points**: Keeps v1.0 and Phase 2 completely isolated
2. **Feature flags**: Easy to toggle Phase 2 on/off
3. **No shared state**: Each version is self-contained
4. **Text-based power-up icons**: Simple but functional, can improve later
5. **Router pattern**: Clean separation of week logic and scene transitions
6. **Progressive tuning**: Gentle onboarding, brutal endgame

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ v1.0 unaffected
- ✅ Both builds work
- ✅ TypeScript clean
- ✅ All Phase 2 features implemented
- 🔄 Manual testing passes
- ⏳ Staging deployment (optional)
- ⏳ PR approved
