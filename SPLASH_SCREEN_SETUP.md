# Splash Screen Setup Instructions

You need to save the retro arcade splash screen image to your project.

### Steps:

1. **Right-click on the image** you shared (the "Calendar Breakout" retro arcade poster)
2. **Save it as:** `splash.jpg`
3. **Location:** Save it in the `public/` folder of your project

**Full path should be:** `C:\Users\hamak\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Bored_Ball\public\splash.jpg`

### Quick PowerShell Command (if image is in Downloads):

```powershell
# If the image is in your Downloads folder, run this from your project root:
Copy-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\splash.jpg" "public\splash.jpg"
```

Once you've saved the image:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# or
npm run dev

2. Click it to see 3-2-1 countdown
3. Click to launch ball
4. Clear all blocks
5. Splash appears again for Week 2!

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load texture 'splash'" error
- Make sure the image is saved as `public/splash.jpg`
- Check the filename is exactly `splash.jpg` (lowercase)
- The image must be in the `public/` folder, not `public/sprites/`

### Image doesn't display
- Check browser console for errors
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Verify image path in browser: `http://localhost:3000/splash.jpg`

### Countdown doesn't start
- Make sure you're clicking directly on the splash image
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## üé® Customization

### Change Countdown Style
Edit the `createSplashScreen()` method in `MainScene.ts`:

```typescript
this.countdownText = this.add.text(width / 2, height / 2, '', {
  fontFamily: 'Impact, Arial Black, sans-serif',  // Change font
  fontSize: '120px',                              // Change size
  color: '#FFD700',                               // Change color
  stroke: '#FF6600',                              // Change outline
  strokeThickness: 8,                             // Change thickness
});
```

### Change Countdown Speed
Modify the timer delay in `startCountdown()`:

```typescript
const countdownTimer = this.time.addEvent({
  delay: 1000,  // Change to 500 for faster, 1500 for slower (milliseconds)
  repeat: 2,
  // ...
});
```

Once you save the image, commit everything and push:

```bash
git add public/splash.jpg src/game/MainScene.ts
git commit -m "FEATURE: Add splash screen and 3-2-1 countdown for game start and week transitions"
git push origin main
```
