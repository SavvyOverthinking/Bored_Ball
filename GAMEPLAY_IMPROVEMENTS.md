# 🎮 Gameplay Improvements - Version 2.0

## ✨ New Features Implemented

### 1. **Smaller Ball** ✅
- **Old Size:** 24px diameter (12px radius)
- **New Size:** 16px diameter (8px radius)
- **Impact:** More precise gameplay, better skill-based mechanics

### 2. **Block Hit Points System** ✅
Blocks now require multiple hits to destroy based on meeting type:

| Meeting Type | Hit Points | Points per Hit | Destroy Bonus |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Boss** 🔴 | 3 hits | 5 | 30 points |
| **Team** 🟢 | 2 hits | 5 | 20 points |
| **1:1** 🟣 | 2 hits | 5 | 20 points |
| **Lunch** 🟡 | 1 hit | 5 | 10 points |
| **Personal** 🟣 | 1 hit | 5 | 10 points |

**Visual Feedback:**
- Blocks flash when damaged but not destroyed
- Alpha animation shows hit feedback
- Encourages strategic targeting

### 3. **Max 3 Balls Limit** ✅
- **Problem:** Team meeting splits could create unlimited balls
- **Solution:** Hard cap at 3 simultaneous balls
- **Implementation:** Check in `createExtraBall()` prevents spawning beyond limit
- **Impact:** Prevents overwhelming chaos, maintains strategic gameplay

### 4. **Morning-Heavy Calendar** ✅
Meeting distribution now emphasizes early hours:

**Time Distribution:**
- **9am-12pm:** 70% of meetings (18 meetings)
- **12pm-1pm:** Lunch blocks (6 meetings)
- **1pm-5pm:** 30% of meetings (2 meetings)

**Rationale:**
- More targets in upper portion of screen
- Natural "rush hour" feel
- Creates visual density at top
- Encourages upward ball trajectory strategy

### 5. **52-Week Progression System** ✅

**Core Mechanics:**
- Start at Week 1
- Clear all meetings to progress
- 52 total weeks (full year)
- Score persists across weeks
- Lives carry over between weeks

**Week Progression:**
```
Week 1 → Week 2 → ... → Week 52 → Year Complete!
```

**End Conditions:**
- **Week Cleared:** Shows week number, score, "Click to continue"
- **Year Complete:** Shows total score, all 52 weeks cleared message
- **Game Over:** Lose all lives, start from Week 1

### 6. **Week Tracking UI** ✅
- **Display:** Top-left corner
- **Format:** "Week: X / 52"
- **Updates:** Automatically when week changes
- **Styling:** Matches score/lives UI (bold, consistent font)

## 🎯 Gameplay Balance Changes

### Difficulty Curve
1. **Early Weeks (1-10):** Learn mechanics, standard difficulty
2. **Mid Weeks (11-30):** Player has rhythm, blocks require strategic targeting
3. **Late Weeks (31-52):** Mastery required, every shot counts

### Scoring System
**Old System:**
- Flat 10 points per block

**New System:**
- 5 points per hit
- Bonus for destroying harder blocks
- Boss meetings worth 30 total (3 hits × 5 + 15 bonus)
- Encourages aggressive play on high-value targets

### Strategic Depth
1. **Target Priority:** Focus on boss meetings for high scores
2. **Ball Management:** Keep 3 balls in play for max efficiency
3. **Physics Effects:** Team meetings become more valuable (splits)
4. **Risk/Reward:** Harder blocks = more points but take longer

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### New Data Structures
```typescript
// MainScene.ts additions
private blockHitPoints: Map<string, number>  // Track HP per block
private currentWeek: number = 1              // Current week number
private totalWeeks: number = 52              // Total weeks in game
private weekText: GameObjects.Text           // Week display UI
```

### Key Methods Added

#### `getHitPointsForMeeting(type: MeetingType): number`
Returns hit points based on meeting type

#### `ballHitBlock(ball, block)`
Updated to handle:
- HP tracking
- Damage feedback (flash animation)
- Partial score on hit
- Full score on destroy

#### `nextWeek()`
Handles week progression:
- Increments week counter
- Clears all game objects
- Regenerates blocks
- Resets ball
- Updates UI

#### `updateWeek()`
Updates week counter UI display

#### `hideOverlay()`
Utility to hide win/lose overlays

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### Block Damage Feedback
```typescript
this.tweens.add({
  targets: block,
  alpha: 0.5,      // Fade to 50%
  duration: 100,    // Quick flash
  yoyo: true,      // Return to normal
  ease: 'Power1'
});
```

### UI Layout
```
Week: 1 / 52                    Score: 240
                                Lives: 3

## 🎮 Gameplay Tips

### For Players:
1. **Prioritize Boss Meetings** - They're worth the most points (30)
2. **Keep 3 Balls Active** - Hit team meetings to split balls
3. **Morning Rush** - Most meetings are 9am-12pm, focus there
4. **Save Lives** - You need to survive 52 weeks!
5. **Lunch Breaks** - Easy 1-hit clears, good for ball control

### Strategy Guide:
- **Early Game:** Build up ball count to 3
- **Mid Game:** Focus on high-value targets (boss meetings)
- **Late Game:** Maintain ball count, don't lose lives

## 🐛 Known Issues / Edge Cases

### Handled:
- ✅ Ball limit prevents infinite splitting
- ✅ Hit points persist correctly

- ✅ Overlay shows/hides properly

### To Monitor:
- ⚠️ Very fast balls may occasionally pass through blocks
- ⚠️ 3-ball limit might feel restrictive (gameplay testing needed)
- ⚠️ 52 weeks may be too long (consider adjustable difficulty)

## 📊 Metrics to Track

### Player Engagement:
- Average week reached
- Total score achieved
- Blocks destroyed per minute
- Accuracy (hits / total blocks)

### Difficulty Balance:
- Lives lost per week
- Time to clear each week
- Week-over-week retention
