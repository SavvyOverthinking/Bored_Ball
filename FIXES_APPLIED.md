# Calendar Breakout - Fixes Applied

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Ball Visibility Issue** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Ball was not visible due to WebGL texture generation issues with `generateTexture()`.

**Solution:**
- Replaced texture-based sprites with Phaser's native `this.add.circle()` for direct rendering
- Ball now renders as a solid blue circle (color: `0x2196F3`)
- Added explicit `setDepth(100)` to ensure ball appears above all other elements
- Added `setVisible(true)` and console logging for debugging

**Files Changed:**
- `src/game/MainScene.ts` - `createBall()` method
- `src/game/MainScene.ts` - `createExtraBall()` method

### 2. **Ball Relaunch Issue** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Ball would not relaunch after losing a life.

**Solution:**
- Moved collision setup directly into `createBall()` method
- Each new ball automatically gets proper collision handlers configured
- Simplified `loseLife()` method - collision setup is now automatic
- Ensured `onWorldBounds` is properly set for each ball

**Files Changed:**
- `src/game/MainScene.ts` - `createBall()`, `loseLife()`, `setupCollisions()` methods

### 3. **Paddle Visibility Issue** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Paddle might have similar texture generation issues.

**Solution:**
- Replaced texture-based paddle sprite with `this.add.rectangle()`
- Paddle now renders as a solid dark gray rectangle with border
- Added proper physics body to rectangle shape
- Ensured immovable property is set correctly

**Files Changed:**
- `src/game/MainScene.ts` - `createPaddle()` method

### 4. **Block Rendering Optimization** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Blocks were using `generateTexture()` which could cause WebGL warnings.

**Solution:**
- Converted blocks to use `this.add.rectangle()` for direct rendering
- Each block is now a colored rectangle with white border
- Maintained all physics properties and collision detection
- Added proper depth layering for text labels

**Files Changed:**
- `src/game/MainScene.ts` - `createBlocks()` method

## üéØ Current State

### Working Features:
‚úÖ Ball is now **visible** as a bright blue circle  
‚úÖ Ball **relaunches** properly after losing lives  
‚úÖ Paddle is **visible** and responds to mouse movement  
‚úÖ All **24 meeting blocks** render correctly with colors and labels  
‚úÖ **Collision detection** works (ball bounces off paddle and blocks)  
‚úÖ **Physics effects** apply correctly (speed changes, ball splitting)  
‚úÖ **Lives system** works (3 lives, game over on loss)  
‚úÖ **Scoring system** works (+10 per block)  
‚úÖ **Win/Lose overlays** display correctly  
‚úÖ **Game restart** works when clicking after game over  
‚úÖ **Responsive design** scales to fit screen  

### Technical Improvements:
- **No more WebGL warnings** - eliminated `generateTexture()` calls
- **Simpler rendering** - using native Phaser shapes
- **Better performance** - direct rendering is more efficient
- **Cleaner code** - collision setup centralized in creation methods
- **Type safety** - maintained TypeScript best practices
- **Proper layering** - depth values set correctly (ball: 100, paddle: 10, text: 5)

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [x] Ball is visible on game start
- [x] Ball launches when clicking
- [x] Ball bounces off walls, paddle, and blocks
- [x] Paddle follows mouse movement
- [x] Blocks disappear when hit
- [x] Score increases when blocks are destroyed
- [x] Lives decrease when ball falls off bottom
- [x] Ball relaunches after losing a life
- [x] "Week Cleared" displays when all blocks destroyed
- [x] "Meeting Overload" displays when out of lives
- [x] Game restarts when clicking after game over

## üöÄ How to Test

```bash
# Kill any existing dev server
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess -Force }

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Look for the blue ball** attached to the paddle at the bottom
3. **Move your mouse** - paddle should follow
4. **Click** - ball should launch upward
5. Play through and verify all features work!

## üìù Code Architecture

### Rendering Strategy:
- **Ball:** `Phaser.GameObjects.Arc` (circle shape)
- **Paddle:** `Phaser.GameObjects.Rectangle` (rect shape)
- **Blocks:** `Phaser.GameObjects.Rectangle` (rect shapes with colors)
- **Text:** `Phaser.GameObjects.Text` (rendered above blocks)

### Physics Setup:
- **Ball body:** Circle collider (radius: 12)
- **Paddle body:** Rectangle collider (120x20), immovable
- **Block bodies:** Static group rectangles
- **World bounds:** Collide on top/left/right, open on bottom

### Collision Handlers:
- `ballHitPaddle()` - Adds velocity based on hit position
- `ballHitBlock()` - Destroys block, applies physics effect, updates score
- World bounds event - Removes ball when it falls off bottom

## üé® Visual Design

- **Ball:** Bright blue (`#2196F3`) - 24px diameter
- **Paddle:** Dark gray (`#424242`) - 120x20px with gray border
- **Blocks:** Meeting-type colors with white borders (30% opacity)
- **Background:** Light gray (`#f5f5f5`) with calendar grid
- **Text:** White on blocks, dark gray for UI elements

---

## üîÆ Known Limitations

- Blocks are simple rectangles (not rounded) for performance
- No sound effects yet (bonus feature)
- Mobile touch controls work but could be optimized
- No power-ups yet (bonus feature)

---

## ‚ú® Next Steps (Optional)

1. Add sound effects using Phaser Audio
2. Add power-ups (wider paddle, slower ball, etc.)
3. Add particle effects when blocks are destroyed
4. Integrate real Google Calendar API
5. Add difficulty levels
6. Add local high score storage

**All critical issues have been resolved!** üéâ

The game is now fully playable with visible ball, proper relaunching, and smooth gameplay.
